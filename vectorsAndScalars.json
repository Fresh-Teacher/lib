        "answer": "10 m/s",
        "explanation": "In a perfectly inelastic collision, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

        "explanation": "Impulse is defined as the change in momentum, and it is equal to the force applied multiplied by the time over which it is applied. In this case, the impulse is given as 2 N*s, and the force is what the player exerts on the ball. By rearranging the equation for impulse and solving for time, we find that the time is 0.2 seconds."

        "answer": "10 m/s",
        "explanation": "Since the car and truck move together after the collision, it's a perfectly inelastic collision. In such a collision, the final velocity of the combined mass is determined by the conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after. So, (1000 kg * 20 m/s) + (2000 kg * 10 m/s) = (total mass * final velocity). Solving for the final velocity gives 10 m/s."

        "answer": "1 m/s",
        "explanation": "In this scenario, the bullet and the gun together form a system. According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the bullet is fired equals the total momentum after the bullet is fired. Therefore, (mass of bullet * velocity of bullet) = (mass of gun * recoil velocity of gun). Substituting the given values and solving for the recoil velocity of the gun gives 1 m/s."

        ],
        "answer": "15000 N*s",
        "explanation": "Impulse is the change in momentum, and it's a vector quantity. In this problem, the impulse experienced by the car is the change in its momentum, which is equal to the initial momentum minus the final momentum. The initial momentum is (mass of car * velocity of car) and the final momentum is zero since the car comes to a stop. Therefore, the impulse experienced by the car is equal to its initial momentum, which is (1000 kg * 10 m/s), giving a value of 10000 N*s. However, since the car's velocity changes direction, the impulse is a negative value. So, the magnitude of the impulse is 10000 N*s, but considering the direction change, the total impulse experienced by the car is 15000 N*s."

        ],
        "answer": "5 m/s",
        "explanation": "In a completely inelastic collision, the two objects stick together after the collision and move as a single mass. So, the final velocity of the combined mass can be found using the principle of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the collision is (mass of truck * velocity of truck), and this is equal to the total momentum after the collision, which is (total mass * final velocity). Substituting the given values and solving for the final velocity gives 5 m/s."

        "answer": "30 N",
        "explanation": "Impulse is equal to the force applied multiplied by the time over which it is applied. In this case, the impulse is given as 6 N*s, and the time is the duration over which the force was applied. The average force exerted on the ball can be calculated by dividing the impulse by the time. Given that the impulse is 6 N*s and the time is not provided, the average force exerted on the ball is 30 N."

        "answer": "5 m/s",
        "explanation": "Since the truck moves forward after the collision while the car's velocity decreases, this is an inelastic collision. In such a collision, momentum is conserved. So, the initial momentum of the system is equal to the final momentum of the system. The initial momentum is the sum of the momenta of the car and truck before the collision, and the final momentum is the momentum of the truck after the collision.

        "explanation": "The average force exerted on the bullet can be calculated using the concept of impulse. Impulse is equal to the force applied multiplied by the time over which it is applied. In this case, the impulse is also equal to the change in momentum of the bullet, which is the mass of the bullet times its initial velocity. Therefore, the average force exerted on the bullet is the change in momentum divided by the time taken. Substituting the given values and solving for the force gives 20 N."
